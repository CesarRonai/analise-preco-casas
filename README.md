## Overview

In this project, we develop a predictive model to estimate house prices based on various features like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more. The workflow includes:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset and transforming variables.
2. **Model Training**: Using ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression with feature selection.
3. **Box-Cox Transformation**: Applied to stabilize variance and normalize target variables.
4. **Visualization**: Graphical representation of residuals and correlation analysis.

This project is modularized to ensure each part of the process is clear and reusable.
